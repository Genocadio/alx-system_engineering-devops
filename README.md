# ALX System Engineering & DevOps Project

## Overview

This program is designed to teach learners about system engineering and DevOps practices, including cloud computing, containerization, continuous integration and delivery, infrastructure as code, monitoring and logging, and security.

The program covers a wide range of topics, starting with shell projects that cover different shell commands such as ls, pwd, man, cat, etc.

### Shell Basics

The shell basics project is composed of several modules:

- `shell_basics`

- `shell_variables_expansions`

These modules cover the fundamentals of working with the shell, including basic commands, permissions, input/output redirection, and variable expansions.

By the end of this program, learners will have the skills and knowledge necessary to design, build, and deploy software systems at scale using modern DevOps practices.
